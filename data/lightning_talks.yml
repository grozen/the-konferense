    mobile device in our hackathon. From theory to market and what have been our
    obstacles from a technical and a product perspective. Where are we today
    after a long year.

  title: It's the little things that make me happy
  abstract:
    Ruby’s original heresy was to place the happiness of the programmer on a
    pedestal - above many other competing and valid concerns that had driven
    programming languages before it. Rails took this one step further with
    "The Principle of The Bigger Smile”; design with great attention paid to
    whatever would make developers smile more and broader.

    What does that even mean? Lots of examples in this fun lightning talk!

  title: '@TODO
  abstract: Have you ever refactored your dotfiles instead of preparing for tomorrow's demo? Have you caught your teammate rearranging the SCRUM board for the 3rd time this week? We software people are all too often plagued by procrastination. In this talk I'll argue that instead of fighting one's weaker self, or more adequately said in German, one's "innerer Schweinehund" one should start embracing the ability to procrastinate as a valuable strength. Let's all put off things together!

  title: The Wild World of Platform Integrations
  abstract: Klarna products are integrated in many platforms across the supported markets. The process of integrating the products is often completed by vendors outside of Klarna.  This session will take a look at how these efforts are approached differently across the platforms based on platform type (open source vs. SaaS), size of merchants on the platforms, setup of the relationship with the platform and/or vendor completing the work and the numerous other factors that impact the final build of the integration.  We will also explore steps being taken to improve the time and quality to market for the platforms across all Klarna markets as well as involvement of market resources throughout the process to ensure the integration meets each market's’ needs.
