  title: Agile Retro Games
  abstract:
    In this Talk I want to share the advantage of "Retro Games" compared to
    normal retrospectives and give a humour oriented view of past retrospectives
    so that SCRUM Masters who haven't thought about or done them yet might think
    about it in the future, and tell the "victims" of the games why they are
    useful.

  title: The Wild World of Platform Integrations
  abstract:
    Klarna products are integrated in many platforms across the
    supported markets. The process of integrating the products is often
    completed by vendors outside of Klarna.


    This session will take a look at how these efforts are approached
    differently across the platforms based on platform type (open source vs.
    SaaS), size of merchants on the platforms, setup of the relationship with
    the platform and/or vendor completing the work and the numerous other
    factors that impact the final build of the integration.


    We will also explore steps being taken to improve the time and quality to
    market for the platforms across all Klarna markets as well as involvement of
    market resources throughout the process to ensure the integration meets each
    market's needs.

  title: It's the little things that make me happy
  abstract:
    Ruby’s original heresy was to place the happiness of the programmer on a
    pedestal - above many other competing and valid concerns that had driven
    programming languages before it. Rails took this one step further with
    "The Principle of The Bigger Smile”; design with great attention paid to
    whatever would make developers smile more and broader.


    What does that even mean? Lots of examples in this fun lightning talk!

  title: We've been water my friend
  abstract:
    This is a follow up to last years talk "Be Water My Friend". What has been
    done and how did we process after exploring new ways to pay with SOFORT on a
    mobile device in our hackathon. From theory to market and what have been our
    obstacles from a technical and a product perspective. Where are we today
    after a long year.

  title: 'Xiaowang: Data Anonymization and Generation tool'
  abstract:
    While executing performance tests, we want to reuse production data to keep
    the correct data distribution. For privacy reason, we have implemented a
    tool which can obfuscate the data while keeping the relations and
    distribution between the fields as in the original production data. Using
    this approach, we can also test for future growth by running the same
    process several times (for example generating 100M rows of test data from
    1M rows of production data). The tool supports multiple data types like
    uuid, datetime, text, email, ip, numeric and custom functions.


    Xiaowang is a simple ruby script which is very easy to start and use
    (tested with Linux/Mac, Ruby 2.0.0/2.2.2)

  title: Do you really know what this is?
  abstract:
    If you've ever written in Javascript - you probably noticed some
    weird parts in it. Does THIS cross your mind? If you’re a beginner and even
    if you're not - THIS is confusing! Let's figure out how it works in
    Javascript.

  title: '@todo'
  abstract:
    Have you ever refactored your dotfiles instead of preparing for
    tomorrow\'s demo? Have you caught your teammate rearranging the SCRUM board
    for the 3rd time this week? We software people are all too often plagued by
    procrastination.


    In this talk I'll argue that instead of fighting one's weaker
    self, or more adequately said in German, one's "innerer Schweinehund" one
    should start embracing the ability to procrastinate as a valuable strength.
    Let's all put off things together!
