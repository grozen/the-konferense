      title: Predicting Customer Behaviour with Machine Learn at Klarna
      abstract:
        Understanding customer payment behaviour is central to the business model of
        Klarna as part of credit underwriting.$MORE$ Even with great collection it would be
        very expensive and immoral to grant anyone who asks credit. Therefore,
        knowing beforehand if a customer is likely to pay their invoice is of great
        importance to us so that we can choose to reject those that will not be able
        to, or otherwise lack intent to pay. But how do we do this more specifically?
        How do we estimate the probability of default and what do we do with it? How
        can we identify and stop fraudulent purchase attempts automatically?


        In this talk I will take you through the whole process of decision model
        development. This includes everything from root cause analysis and
        data-mining to feature engineering, training and validation of machine
        learning models and designing decision policies.. I will introduce you to the
        specific problems we encounter in credit underwriting and how we try to solve
        these problems in an automated way.

      title: Eight years living with Kred
      abstract:
        Kreditor started out as a factoring business specifically geared
        towards e-commerce. Kred, therefore, started as, and at heart still is,
        a factoring support system. This, along with a few other crucial
        business decisions, developments and accidents has shaped and continues
        to affect the system as it stands today.$MORE$


        This talk will present a few of those developments, along with some of
        their consequences that are still visible today, in code, data
        structures, workflows and business procedures. This will in turn
        develop into a few key learnings about how Klarna got to be where it is
        today, what baggage it is carrying with it, what mistakes we may not
        want to make again, and what traits and properties of Klarna and its
        systems that we may want to develop, maintain and preserve.

      title: Weekend at Bernie's (Security)
      abstract: 
        We will explore the landscape of client side
        attacks with a pinch of user awareness.$MORE$


        We will walk you through (even dare to demo)
        different attack scenarios which differ in
        nature but they can all eventually link up
        to be used in a chain. These scenarios range
        from semi-targeted phishing campaigns and
        leakage of wireless-related information to
        man in the middle attacks and full
        exploitation of workstations. We will try to
        make all this relevant to Klarna's
        environment and attack surface. 


        This is a talk about every day hacking and
        exploitation techniques that are simple
        enough to explain to your parents but
        technical enough to visit stackoverflow
        after we are done. We will build on last
        year's lightning talk, but don't worry if
        you missed it, we will recap quite fast.

      title: Lambda and Kappa - Durable, accurate, low latency application serving layers
      abstract:
        Klarna live applications require near real time data latency as well as
        vast data history depth from multiple sources. Combined with
        requirements of horizontal application scalability and statelessness, a
        traditional data serving solution (e.g. centralised RDBMS) does not cut
        the cheese. $MORE$
        
        
        For the past three years Klarna has implemented the Lambda
        Architecture serving applications with data for real time decisions.
        Since then, new architectural proposals has emerged in the BigData
        community. One upriser is the Kappa architecture. In this talk we look
        at Klarnas current Lambda architecture, then we look at the Kappa
        proposal including a case study. Finally we discuss how Kappa could
        replace our current Lambda architecture and what would have to change.

        up to? As a recent newbie at Risk Engineering I'll open up the black
        box that is RaaS and together we will look at the many moving parts
        that make up RaaS. $MORE$
        

        At the end of this talk you will have retraced my
        steps from RaaS noob to becoming proficient enough to know whatever
        RaaS is all about.
