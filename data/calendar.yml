      title: Predicting Customer Behaviour with Machine Learn at Klarna
      abstract:
        Understanding customer payment behaviour is central to the business model of
        Klarna as part of credit underwriting.$MORE$ Even with great collection it would be
        very expensive and immoral to grant anyone who asks credit. Therefore,
        knowing beforehand if a customer is likely to pay their invoice is of great
        importance to us so that we can choose to reject those that will not be able
        to, or otherwise lack intent to pay. But how do we do this more specifically?
        How do we estimate the probability of default and what do we do with it? How
        can we identify and stop fraudulent purchase attempts automatically?   


        In this talk I will take you through the whole process of decision model
        development. This includes everything from root cause analysis and
        data-mining to feature engineering, training and validation of machine
        learning models and designing decision policies.. I will introduce you to the
        specific problems we encounter in credit underwriting and how we try to solve
        these problems in an automated way.

      title: Weekend at Bernie's (Security)
      abstract: 
        We will explore the landscape of client side
        attacks with a pinch of user awareness.$MORE$


        We will walk you through (even dare to demo)
        different attack scenarios which differ in
        nature but they can all eventually link up
        to be used in a chain. These scenarios range
        from semi-targeted phishing campaigns and
        leakage of wireless-related information to
        man in the middle attacks and full
        exploitation of workstations. We will try to
        make all this relevant to Klarna's
        environment and attack surface. 


        This is a talk about every day hacking and
        exploitation techniques that are simple
        enough to explain to your parents but
        technical enough to visit stackoverflow
        after we are done. We will build on last
        year's lightning talk, but don't worry if
        you missed it, we will recap quite fast.
