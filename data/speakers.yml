    I'm working as a software engineer at Klarna for more than 5 years, having worked with Erlang, Java and Ruby. I'm developing product features but tend to also focus a lot on the infrastructure. Among the things I like are continuous delivery, Docker and immutable infrastructure.
    Previously I worked with mobile Java implementations at Sun Microsystems.

  bio: 
    Martin has been dabbling in Erlang for fun since 2004, and has kept dabbling for Klarna since 2008. From the start as a junior developer in the only engineering team that existed at the time, and from then on either with dunning related development, or with the beards in the Kred Core team. He has no beard, but a student of many diverse subjects, he has an MSc in psychology from Gothenburg University, something he has found both highly useful and pretty annoying in many situations at Klarna.

georgios:

  work:
    company: Klarna
  bio: Georgios is a farmer at heart who gave up his dreams when his grandparents told him that farming requires waking up really early in the morning. Many years later, he started as a UNIX sysadmin while studying Computer Engineering. He soon realised this is too hard when his mail server got hacked and he had to postpone sleeping for some days until the server was back online. “Life would be so much easier if I were a web developer instead”, he thought but when a senior colleague demoed an SQL injection he had introduced, he despaired and decided to join the dark side. And there he roams for the last decade…

  work:
    company: Klarna
  bio: I started programming at age 9, tweaking assembler code to move pixels on the screen. I eventually passed through Visual Basic and Java. I worked for a while in an inventory management application built in Java and I thought about quitting programming; instead, I found Rails, and I since then I'm fascinated by the possibilities.
       I believe programming is, overall, a form of communication.
