  bio:
    "Software developer for about 10 years.
    I started off at the age of 18 as a developer in the Israeli army (top secret!). A few years later I started working for a start-up company in the field of online fraud detection, which was acquired by PayPal shortly after and so I worked for PayPal for a while.
    From there I moved from sin-city Tel Aviv to the holy-land of Jerusalem, to study Computer Science and Cognitive Science in the Hebrew University. After graduating I found my way to Klarna, where I’ve been for over 3 years, during which I had the privilege to co-found Rails Girls events in Israel.
    I’m very passionate about traveling around the world (just recently completed my 30-countries-before-30 challenge!), and also passionate about puzzles in general and puzzle-rooms in particular"

And there he roams for the last decade…
