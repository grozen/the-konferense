    Martin has been dabbling in Erlang for fun since 2004, and has kept dabbling for Klarna since 2008. From the start as a junior developer in the only engineering team that existed at the time, and from then on either with dunning related development, or with the beards in the Kred Core team. He has no beard, but a student of many diverse subjects, he has an MSc in psychology from Gothenburg University, something he has found both highly useful and pretty annoying in many situations at Klarna.

  bio:
    "Software developer for about 10 years.
    I started off at the age of 18 as a developer in the Israeli army (top secret!). A few years later I started working for a start-up company in the field of online fraud detection, which was acquired by PayPal shortly after and so I worked for PayPal for a while.
    From there I moved from sin-city Tel Aviv to the holy-land of Jerusalem, to study Computer Science and Cognitive Science in the Hebrew University. After graduating I found my way to Klarna, where I’ve been for over 3 years, during which I had the privilege to co-found Rails Girls events in Israel.
    I’m very passionate about traveling around the world (just recently completed my 30-countries-before-30 challenge!), and also passionate about puzzles in general and puzzle-rooms in particular"

  bio: Georgios is a farmer at heart who gave up his dreams when his grandparents told him that farming requires waking up really early in the morning. Many years later, he started as a UNIX sysadmin while studying Computer Engineering. He soon realised this is too hard when his mail server got hacked and he had to postpone sleeping for some days until the server was back online. “Life would be so much easier if I were a web developer instead”, he thought but when a senior colleague demoed an SQL injection he had introduced, he despaired and decided to join the dark side. And there he roams for the last decade…
