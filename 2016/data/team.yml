- name: Ben Maraney
  image: avatars/b.maraney.jpg
  bio:
    "Ben became passionate about coding at age 8, when it was a welcome distraction from learning the kinds of things 8-year-olds are supposed to learn. Despite his hobby continuing to get in the way he graduated with a degree in Natural Sciences and Middle Eastern Studies from Cambridge University.
     For reasons best explained over beer, he moved to Israel where his formal education did not help his employment prospects in the slightest. Fortunately it seems that in Tel Aviv people are willing to pay him to do what he loves best, and he ended up writing code for a living.
     Ben joined Klarna looking to learn from good people. Since then he’s worked with great engineers on Payment Matching, the Settlement App and Personalization.
     He still can’t tell you what 6*7 is, and his handwriting remains illegible.
     Passion is a mixed blessing."
