      title: "Predicting Payment Behaviour: A machine learning approach to risk"
      abstract:
        It would be very expensive and also immoral to grant anyone who asks credit. It is therefore of great importance to predict customer’s future payment behaviour so that we can reject those that will not be able to pay. In this talk I will introduce you to Machine Learning and how we use it to train models that can predict if customers will pay their invoices.$MORE$
        This will include everything from root cause analysis and data-mining to feature engineering, training and validation of machine learning models and decision policy design. I will introduce you to some specific problems we encounter in credit underwriting and how we try to solve these problems in an automated way.

        What is usability testing, why (and how practically) do we do it, and what I learned by putting Klarna Credit to the test.
        In this session I will introduce you to usability testing. We will have a look at the tests we did in the UK and the US prior to the launch of account with the Klarna Credit API. We will have a look at some example recordings from these sessions, and we will look into what these user tests can tell us about cultural differences (around financial products) and the dangers of assuming everything works the same everywhere.

      title: The Wild World of Platform Integrations
      abstract:
        Klarna products are integrated in many platforms across the
        supported markets. The process of integrating the products is often
        completed by vendors outside of Klarna. $MORE$


        This session will take a look at how these efforts are approached
        differently across the platforms based on platform type (open source vs.
        SaaS), size of merchants on the platforms, setup of the relationship with
        the platform and/or vendor completing the work and the numerous other
        factors that impact the final build of the integration.


        We will also explore steps being taken to improve the time and quality to
        market for the platforms across all Klarna markets as well as involvement of
        market resources throughout the process to ensure the integration meets each
        market's needs.

      title: Keynote - Farley’s Laws
      abstract:
        We are not as smart as we think we are. Even us software developers!!
        What we think of as reality isn't. When we think we are being rational, we are not. When we listen to experts and trust in their wisdom, we are fooling ourselves.
        Meanwhile, software development is one of the more complex $MORE$ tasks that we mere mortals undertake. So what does it really take to overcome the limitations of our biology? How do we overcome our desire to jump to conclusions and guess at solutions?
        This mildly humorous, entertaining talk explores some of the fallibilities inherent in our biology and addresses what it takes to solve genuinely complex problems in the face of our propensity to make wild guesses?
        To put it another way, what do you need to understand to completely grasp how agile, lean development, DevOps and Continuous Delivery really work?

      title: Weekend at Bernie's (Security)
      abstract:
        We will explore the landscape of client side
        attacks with a pinch of user awareness.
        We will walk you through (even dare to demo)
        different attack scenarios which differ in
        nature but they can all eventually link up
        to be used in a chain. $MORE$ These scenarios range
        from semi-targeted phishing campaigns and
        leakage of wireless-related information to
        man in the middle attacks and full
        exploitation of workstations. We will try to
        make all this relevant to Klarna's
        environment and attack surface.
        This is a talk about every day hacking and
        exploitation techniques that are simple
        enough to explain to your parents but
        technical enough to visit stackoverflow
        after we are done. We will build on last
        year's lightning talk, but don't worry if
        you missed it, we will recap quite fast.

      title: Lambda and Kappa - Durable, accurate, low latency application serving layers
      abstract:
        Klarna live applications require near real time data latency as well as
        vast data history depth from multiple sources. Combined with
        requirements of horizontal application scalability and statelessness, a
        traditional data serving solution (e.g. centralised RDBMS) does not cut
        the cheese. $MORE$
        For the past three years Klarna has implemented the Lambda
        Architecture serving applications with data for real time decisions.
        Since then, new architectural proposals has emerged in the BigData
        community. One upriser is the Kappa architecture. In this talk we look
        at Klarnas current Lambda architecture, then we look at the Kappa
        proposal including a case study. Finally we discuss how Kappa could
        replace our current Lambda architecture and what would have to change.

      title: "The Many Ways to do DevOps: A Journey"
      abstract:
        We've all heard that one should deploy small changes and deploy often. This is great but it gets harder to figure out which tools/techniques to use for a given application at hand given multiple available deployment strategies and different types of applications. What should be automated and $MORE$ what shouldn’t? This talk will be an experience-based DevOps journey story of attempting to achieve a stable and organisationally scalable delivery process. It will be an extended version of the lightning talk I did at muCon Stockholm 2015 "Scaling infrastructure work at Klarna". In the talk I will present the alternative approaches and principles behind the different deployment tools, what worked and what didn't work for us, where the infrastructure tools are heading and how can a DevOps person avoid becoming a bottleneck by sharing knowledge within the team.

      title: Eight Years Living with Kred
      abstract:
        Kreditor started out as a factoring business specifically geared
        towards e-commerce. Kred, therefore, started as, and at heart still is,
        a factoring support system. This, along with a few other crucial
        business decisions, developments and accidents has shaped and continues
        to affect the system as it stands today.$MORE$
        This talk will present a few of those developments, along with some of
        their consequences that are still visible today, in code, data
        structures, workflows and business procedures. This will in turn
        develop into a few key learnings about how Klarna got to be where it is
        today, what baggage it is carrying with it, what mistakes we may not
        want to make again, and what traits and properties of Klarna and its
        systems that we may want to develop, maintain and preserve.
