She thinks life is better with a smile, and that\'s why you might recognise her by her loud laugh. But it\'s all a trick! She is part of LiveOps, those mean people that wake you up in the middle of the night and ask for Incident Reports when things break!

    name: 'Dario Pasquantonio',
    bio: 'Dario was not like the other Italians. Dario didn\'t have a funny accent, he didn\'t use his hands during a conversation. He didn\'t love his mom, didn\'t like good food, the sun or the crystal clear sea. One day he had enough: he packed his backpack, and started seeking new adventures. He ended up in Berlin, where he found what he has always been looking for: rain, cold, Pizza Hawaii and darkness. During the last three years he found his place in the FinTech startup scene, in the sombre shadows of the backend; it is a challenging, stressful place, from which he constantly tries to escape using his most powerful weapon: sarcasm.'

Luckily, Wavy emerged from the ashes and he gets to continue working with amazing colleagues. Outside of work, Joe captains a cricket team where he plays with players from all over the world and confuses everyone else in the office with talk of “short legs” and “silly points”. He also satisfies his creative needs by playing classical and jazz piano.'

She attended one year at Karlstad uni and one day at KTH, acquired a medieval jousting team, apprenticed in a smithy, got herself a six shooter and founded a toy weapons store. Thanks to the webshop she decided to study software development, and joined the Klarna Erlang crew one glorious day in May. Karin now resides in the data warehouse team, creating sense and meaning from data where there seem to be none. She loves the puzzles she faces at work, and also really enjoys playing boardgames with friends.'

    name: 'Fernando Vía Canel',
    bio: 'Fernando tried to be a wizard, a warrior and a bard at the same time, so he ended up not being good at anything. As a last measure, to avoid imminent dishonor, he took after his parents and their parents before them and joined the programmer\'s guild as an apprentice. Through toil and sweat he found out that it\'s way easier to make management happy by pushing a couple of pixels than by building rockets, so he slyly turned into a con-art... front-end developer. Totally serious job, and not at all the reason why he is no longer allowed in his ancestor\'s shrine.'

    bio: 'Juan was just a regular kid until one day he bet his soul in a game with the devil and lost. Then, he suddenly learned to play blues and started working with software development, making fortunes in the dotcom bubble. He mastered many open source technologies while studying physics – which he couldn’t find any evidence for – and philosophy – where he could’t find any good argument for the existence of souls. Given the approaching deadline set by the Dark Lord, he decided to move to Israel and learn Hebrew, in order to read God’s words and to seek atonement for his sins. Nowadays he works at Klarna Stockholm, mainly with React and other front end technologies, since he couldn’t find anything more self-flagellating to do.'

Growing up surrounded by computers her dad would bring home, she managed to greet the world through a program for the first time at the age of 11. Little did she know that one day, she would do something similar for living. So here she is now, hacking her days away as an Erlang Solution\'s consultant at Klarna.'

    portrait: johannaSimonssonPortrait,
    name: 'Johanna Simonsson',
    bio: 'After 5 years at university studying Mechanical Engineering, Johanna discovered she didn\'t like machines at all. In fact, the more abstract the concept, the better. Fortunately, coding seemed to be just that. She steered her career away from anything tangible, and ended up at Klarna as a System Engineer herding non-tangible machines in the cloud. As she succeeded abstracting her world at work, in private Johanna likes everything low-tech, old and manual. This includes cross-stitching, reading fantasy fiction and pre-enlightenment history.'
