    bio: 'Nadia always wanted to be a math teacher but, decided to go for Telecommunications Engineering since it sounded more challenging. She was not wrong! She thinks life is better with a smile, and that\'s why you might recognise her by her loud laugh. But it\'s all a trick! She is part of LiveOps, those mean people that wake you up in the middle of the night and ask for Incident Reports when things break! She likes to keep herself busy and loves to give back by being part of initiatives such as ClojureBridge, GeekGirlMeetup, and PinkProgramming Summer Camps. She also likes to talk, and what better place to do it than at the KonferenSE?'

Enjoys writing beautiful code that makes sense, quick feedback cycles and long walks on the beach. Vehemently dislikes WordPress. In his spare time, Guy is an avid gamer and family man who desperately attempts to maintain too many additional hobbies.'

    bio: 'Dario was not like the other Italians. Dario didn\'t have a funny accent, he didn\'t use his hands during a conversation. He didn\'t love his mom, didn\'t like good food, the sun or the crystal clear sea. One day he had enough: he packed his backpack, and started seeking new adventures. He ended up in Berlin, where he found what he has always been looking for: rain, cold, Pizza Hawaii and darkness. During the last three years he found his place in the FinTech startup scene, in the sombre shadows of the backend; it is a challenging, stressful place, from which he constantly tries to escape using his most powerful weapon: sarcasm.'

    name: 'Joseph Tindale',
    bio: 'Joe is a European Brit, making him a bit of an outcast in the country of his birth. He moved to Berlin and joined Cookies, a really awesome startup. Unfortunately, the company went insolvent shortly after his arrival, although he is convinced the two events were not connected. Luckily, Wavy emerged from the ashes and he gets to continue working with amazing colleagues. Outside of work, Joe captains a cricket team where he plays with players from all over the world and confuses everyone else in the office with talk of “short legs” and “silly points”. He also satisfies his creative needs by playing classical and jazz piano.'

    name: 'Omri Yariv',
    bio: 'Omri started playing around with building websites as a teenager thinking he could become a Graphic Designer. When he understood he sucks at Graphic Design he moved on to focus on programming. Since then throughout his career he stayed close to the Frontend. His first real-world job was building Flash banners and landing pages for the advertising industry - for this he asks your forgiveness.'

    portrait: karinKullmanPortrait,
    name: 'Karin Kullman',
    bio: 'Karin set out with big dreams in life, but not much of a plan. She attended one year at Karlstad uni and one day at KTH, acquired a medieval jousting team, apprenticed in a smithy, got herself a six shooter and founded a toy weapons store. Thanks to the webshop she decided to study software development, and joined the Klarna Erlang crew one glorious day in May. Karin now resides in the data warehouse team, creating sense and meaning from data where there seem to be none. She loves the puzzles she faces at work, and also really enjoys playing boardgames with friends.'

    portrait: fernandoViaCanelPortrait,
    name: 'Fernando Vía Canel',
    bio: 'Fernando tried to be a wizard, a warrior and a bard at the same time, so he ended up not being good at anything. As a last measure, to avoid imminent dishonor, he took after his parents and their parents before them and joined the programmer\'s guild as an apprentice. Through toil and sweat he found out that it\'s way easier to make management happy by pushing a couple of pixels than by building rockets, so he slyly turned into a con-art... front-end developer. Totally serious job, and not at all the reason why he is no longer allowed in his ancestor\'s shrine.'

    bio: 'Mariana is a passionate software developer by day and a graphic designer by night. Some of the teams at Klarna have logos created by Mariana.&nbsp;What you might not know is that she studied human computer interaction and usability. Then she had a short stint in a german fabLab learning and having fun with laser cutters and electronics where Mariana manufactured her own small batch of arduino clones. &nbsp;The thing Mariana enjoys the most is learning new things! One of her learning journeys led her to discover clojure well enough to teach it to beginners. Now she is developing in clojure with her current team. Her next learning challenge became Machine learning...'

    name: 'Maja Kontrec',
    bio: 'Maja is a passionate (functional) programmer and a musician. As an artist in engineers body, she is always curious about finding unusual solutions to usual problems. Growing up surrounded by computers her dad would bring home, she managed to greet the world through a program for the first time at the age of 11. Little did she know that one day, she would do something similar for living. So here she is now, hacking her days away as an Erlang Solution\'s consultant at Klarna.'

    portrait: johannaSimonssonPortrait,
    name: 'Johanna Simonsson',
    bio: 'After 3 years at university studying Mechanical Engineering, Johanna discovered she didn\'t like machines at all. In fact, the more abstract the concept, the better. Fortunately, coding seemed to be just that. She steered her career away from anything tangible, and ended up at Klarna as a System Engineer herding non-tangible machines in the cloud. As she succeeded abstracting her world at work, in private Johanna likes everything low-tech, old and manual. This includes cross-stitching, reading fantasy fiction and pre-enlightenment history.'

In 2015, he left behind the tropical heat and moved to Stockholm to join Klarna, where he has been working on Klarna Checkout and Payments.
