Yet as a society we pressure folks to pigeonhole themselves into silos: pick a major at university, choose an industry to work in, buy a house and settle down. Nowhere is this more true than in the world of tech, where there is often no clear path from engineer or product manager to leader. But what if you want to move around, especially at work? In this talk, Kara shares three key lessons gleaned from over a decade moving seamlessly between the highest levels tech, entertainment, and sports and how you can apply those strategies to your career.',

Never fear, when you come to my talk you will get an overview of the types of machine learning and different ways in which people are using it!&nbsp;The first step is demystifying the math. All you need to know is what the terms mean so you know which functions to call to start getting results!&nbsp;Now that you know the what let\'s explore the how! You will learn to identify good problems and I will walk you through my own learning experience.&nbsp;Finally, I will give you some tips on how to solve the problems you have today and the ones you will encounter tomorrow (or maybe just let your robot do those too).',

It will show you how to model your own evolution by teaching you how to tailor your own, specific crossover and mutation operators and how to choose the fittest individuals to drive forward your search of a solution.&nbsp;To prove that all of this is true and working, we are going to play with some usual and unusual applications of the evolution - from a small world with animals trying to evolve to get more food and mates, to usage of evolution in music composition and medicine.',

I will also tell you about the Days of Improvement, during which we were blissfully unaware of the impending D-Day, the KCloud Decommission, the day which put everything to the test.&nbsp;But how did it end? Did it end? Did we solve our initial problem? Did we learn anything by implementing a cool, new, bleeding edge technology? By digging through post mortems and the shared team memory, I\'ll share the war stories of porting our entire service portfolio to a new platform, and teach you what you need to know if you ever want to go to war.',

        description: 'Most developers are familiar with the concept of ‚Äútechnical debt‚Äù. Technical debt comes in many forms: it\'s constant library updates, security patches, changing contracts with other tools and systems, and many other. All of these become a ‚Äútax‚Äù on working software. It may be possible to ignore this tax for certain amount of time but after a while either the software stops working or the changes to it become really hard to perform. Many developers participated in rewriting some existing legacy system from scratch. When does software become ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù and how can its lifetime be prolonged? Can we avoid rewriting everything from scratch every 5 years? Do microservices change things? How will containerisation affect this? What about serverless infrastructure? Why some tools like Heroku call themselves ‚Äúerosion resistant‚Äù?&nbsp;I don\'t aim to provide ready-made answers, but I hope to raise awareness and bring up discussions about ways of building maintainable software systems at Klarna.',
