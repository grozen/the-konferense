                              <p>We are not as smart as we think we are. Even us software developers!! What we think of as reality isn't. When we think we are being rational, we are not. When we listen to experts and trust in their wisdom, we are fooling ourselves. Meanwhile, software development is one of the more complex 
 tasks that we mere mortals undertake. So what does it really take to overcome the limitations of our biology? How do we overcome our desire to jump to conclusions and guess at solutions? This mildly humorous, entertaining talk explores some of the fallibilities inherent in our biology and addresses what it takes to solve genuinely complex problems in the face of our propensity to make wild guesses? To put it another way, what do you need to understand to completely grasp how agile, lean development, DevOps and Continuous Delivery really work?</p>

It is therefore of great importance to predict customer’s future payment behaviour so that we can reject those that will not be able to pay. In this talk I will introduce you to Machine Learning and how we use it to train models that can predict if customers will pay their invoices.
 This will include everything from root cause analysis and data-mining to feature engineering, training and validation of machine learning models and decision policy design. I will introduce you to some specific problems we encounter in credit underwriting and how we try to solve these problems in an automated way.</p>

                            <p>Georgios is a farmer at heart who gave up his dreams when his grandparents told him that farming requires waking up really early in the morning. Many years later, he started as a UNIX sysadmin while studying Computer Engineering. He soon realised this is too hard when his mail server got hacked and he had to postpone sleeping for some days until the server was back online. “Life would be so much easier if I were a web developer instead”, he thought but when a senior colleague demoed an SQL injection he had introduced, he despaired and decided to join the dark side. And there he roams for the last decade…</p>

                              <p>We will explore the landscape of client side attacks with a pinch of user awareness. We will walk you through (even dare to demo) different attack scenarios which differ in nature but they can all eventually link up to be used in a chain. 
 These scenarios range from semi-targeted phishing campaigns and leakage of wireless-related information to man in the middle attacks and full exploitation of workstations. We will try to make all this relevant to Klarna's environment and attack surface. This is a talk about every day hacking and exploitation techniques that are simple enough to explain to your parents but technical enough to visit stackoverflow after we are done. We will build on last year's lightning talk, but don't worry if you missed it, we will recap quite fast.</p>

                            <p>I started programming at age 9, tweaking assembler code to move pixels on the screen. I eventually passed through Visual Basic and Java. I worked for a while in an inventory management application built in Java and I thought about quitting programming; instead, I found Rails, and I since then I'm fascinated by the possibilities. I believe programming is, overall, a form of communication.</p>

 For the past three years Klarna has implemented the Lambda Architecture serving applications with data for real time decisions. Since then, new architectural proposals has emerged in the BigData community. One upriser is the Kappa architecture. In this talk we look at Klarnas current Lambda architecture, then we look at the Kappa proposal including a case study. Finally we discuss how Kappa could replace our current Lambda architecture and what would have to change.</p>

Interested in Distributed Systems, concurrency, the actors computational model and some sprinkles of STMs. At Klarna, he started working with Kred, in the dunning side (a word that he didn't even know existed before getting here…), then with customer communications. Later on he was for a while the sole member of the now gone Wall Street team, handling the payments integration area of the Kasper platform. On his spare time he currently is trying to learn Swedish (finally!). Previous to Klarna, he taught some classes in the University as well.</p>

We'll start with what's the payment lifecycle, and then see how each PSP communicates it to us. While at it, we will see all kinds of mishaps that we, as developers, have to deal every time we need to integrate 
 with a new PSP or a bank. You'll get to know our 'Book of Doom', and why it got that name. Although I will talk about some of the tools that we use to do our job, this is NOT meant to be a technical talk.</p>

                              <p>We've all heard that one should deploy small changes and deploy often. This is great but it gets harder to figure out which tools/techniques to use for a given application at hand given multiple available tools (Capistrano, Chef, Ansible, Vagrant, 
 just shell, docker, container orchestration tools, etc) and multiple types of applications (web apps, databases, batch job apps, data pipeline apps, etc). What should be automated and what shouldn’t? This talk will be an experience-based DevOps journey story of attempting to achieve a stable and organisationally scalable delivery process. It will be an extended version of the lightning talk I did at muCon Stockholm 2015 "Scaling infrastructure work at Klarna". In the talk I will structure the alternative approaches and principles behind the different deployment tools, what worked and what didn't work for us, where the deployment tools are heading and how can a DevOps person avoid becoming a bottleneck by sharing knowledge within the team.</p>

<p>This session will take a look at how these efforts are approached differently across the platforms based on platform type (open source vs. SaaS), size of merchants on the platforms, setup of the relationship with the platform and/or vendor completing the work and the numerous other factors that impact the final build of the integration.</p>

From the start as a junior developer in the only engineering team that existed at the time, and from then on either with dunning related development, or with the beards in the Kred Core team. He has no beard, but a student of many diverse subjects, he has an MSc in psychology from Gothenburg University, something he has found both highly useful and pretty annoying in many situations at Klarna.</p>

 This talk will present a few of those developments, along with some of their consequences that are still visible today, in code, data structures, workflows and business procedures. This will in turn develop into a few key learnings about how Klarna got to be where it is today, what baggage it is carrying with it, what mistakes we may not want to make again, and what traits and properties of Klarna and its systems that we may want to develop, maintain and preserve.</p>

As part of the merchant team "Das Kartell" he develops the merchant and admin CRM system and some of the banking logics. He wanted to be a part of the conference team since he attended the first one in 2015 and hopes to bring some of his 10+ years of working into the planning. In his leisure Hannes likes to read books of Terry Pratchett and Stephen King, plays mostly RPG games (and some shooters) on the computer and loves to cycle.</p>

                <p>Software developer for about 10 years. I started off at the age of 18 as a developer in the Israeli army (top secret!). A few years later I started working for a start-up company in the field of online fraud detection, which was acquired by PayPal shortly after and so I worked for PayPal for a while. From there I moved from sin-city Tel Aviv to the holy-land of Jerusalem, to study Computer Science and Cognitive Science in the Hebrew University. After graduating I found my way to Klarna, where I’ve been for over 3 years, during which I had the privilege to co-found Rails Girls events in Israel. I’m very passionate about traveling around the world (just recently completed my 30-countries-before-30 challenge!), and also passionate about puzzles in general and puzzle-rooms in particular</p>

                <p>Ruby’s original heresy was to place the happiness of the programmer on a pedestal - above many other competing and valid concerns that had driven programming languages before it. Rails took this one step further with "The Principle of The Bigger Smile”; design with great attention paid to whatever would make developers smile more and broader.</p>

In this talk I will introduce you to Machine Learning and how we use it to train models that can predict if customers will pay their invoices.
 This will include everything from root cause analysis and data-mining to feature engineering, training and validation of machine learning models and decision policy design. I will introduce you to some specific problems we encounter in credit underwriting and how we try to solve these problems in an automated way.</p>

<p>This session will take a look at how these efforts are approached differently across the platforms based on platform type (open source vs. SaaS), size of merchants on the platforms, setup of the relationship with the platform and/or vendor completing the work and the numerous other factors that impact the final build of the integration.</p>

<p>We will also explore steps being taken to improve the time and quality to market for the platforms across all Klarna markets as well as involvement of market resources throughout the process to ensure the integration meets each market's needs.</p>

 This talk will present a few of those developments, along with some of their consequences that are still visible today, in code, data structures, workflows and business procedures. This will in turn develop into a few key learnings about how Klarna got to be where it is today, what baggage it is carrying with it, what mistakes we may not want to make again, and what traits and properties of Klarna and its systems that we may want to develop, maintain and preserve.</p>

                <p>Software developer for about 10 years. I started off at the age of 18 as a developer in the Israeli army (top secret!). A few years later I started working for a start-up company in the field of online fraud detection, which was acquired by PayPal shortly after and so I worked for PayPal for a while. From there I moved from sin-city Tel Aviv to the holy-land of Jerusalem, to study Computer Science and Cognitive Science in the Hebrew University. After graduating I found my way to Klarna, where I’ve been for over 3 years, during which I had the privilege to co-found Rails Girls events in Israel. I’m very passionate about traveling around the world (just recently completed my 30-countries-before-30 challenge!), and also passionate about puzzles in general and puzzle-rooms in particular</p>

Many years later, he started as a UNIX sysadmin while studying Computer Engineering. He soon realised this is too hard when his mail server got hacked and he had to postpone sleeping for some days until the server was back online. “Life would be so much easier if I were a web developer instead”, he thought but when a senior colleague demoed an SQL injection he had introduced, he despaired and decided to join the dark side.

 These scenarios range from semi-targeted phishing campaigns and leakage of wireless-related information to man in the middle attacks and full exploitation of workstations. We will try to make all this relevant to Klarna's environment and attack surface. This is a talk about every day hacking and exploitation techniques that are simple enough to explain to your parents but technical enough to visit stackoverflow after we are done. We will build on last year's lightning talk, but don't worry if you missed it, we will recap quite fast.</p>

 For the past three years Klarna has implemented the Lambda Architecture serving applications with data for real time decisions. Since then, new architectural proposals has emerged in the BigData community. One upriser is the Kappa architecture. In this talk we look at Klarnas current Lambda architecture, then we look at the Kappa proposal including a case study. Finally we discuss how Kappa could replace our current Lambda architecture and what would have to change.</p>

 just shell, docker, container orchestration tools, etc) and multiple types of applications (web apps, databases, batch job apps, data pipeline apps, etc). What should be automated and what shouldn’t? This talk will be an experience-based DevOps journey story of attempting to achieve a stable and organisationally scalable delivery process. It will be an extended version of the lightning talk I did at muCon Stockholm 2015 "Scaling infrastructure work at Klarna". In the talk I will structure the alternative approaches and principles behind the different deployment tools, what worked and what didn't work for us, where the deployment tools are heading and how can a DevOps person avoid becoming a bottleneck by sharing knowledge within the team.</p>

                <p>Software developer for about 10 years. I started off at the age of 18 as a developer in the Israeli army (top secret!). A few years later I started working for a start-up company in the field of online fraud detection, which was acquired by PayPal shortly after and so I worked for PayPal for a while. From there I moved from sin-city Tel Aviv to the holy-land of Jerusalem, to study Computer Science and Cognitive Science in the Hebrew University. After graduating I found my way to Klarna, where I’ve been for over 3 years, during which I had the privilege to co-found Rails Girls events in Israel. I’m very passionate about traveling around the world (just recently completed my 30-countries-before-30 challenge!), and also passionate about puzzles in general and puzzle-rooms in particular</p>

                <p>Ruby’s original heresy was to place the happiness of the programmer on a pedestal - above many other competing and valid concerns that had driven programming languages before it. Rails took this one step further with "The Principle of The Bigger Smile”; design with great attention paid to whatever would make developers smile more and broader.</p>

                            <p>I started programming at age 9, tweaking assembler code to move pixels on the screen. I eventually passed through Visual Basic and Java. I worked for a while in an inventory management application built in Java and I thought about quitting programming; instead, I found Rails, and I since then I'm fascinated by the possibilities. I believe programming is, overall, a form of communication.</p>

                <p>Hannes is working at SOFORT for one year now and loves agile methods. As part of the merchant team "Das Kartell" he develops the merchant and admin CRM system and some of the banking logics. He wanted to be a part of the conference team since he attended the first one in 2015 and hopes to bring some of his 10+ years of working into the planning. In his leisure Hannes likes to read books of Terry Pratchett and Stephen King, plays mostly RPG games (and some shooters) on the computer and loves to cycle.</p>

                <p>In this Talk I want to share the advantage of "Retro Games" compared to normal retrospectives and give a humour oriented view of past retrospectives so that SCRUM Masters who haven't thought about or done them yet might think about it in the future, and tell the "victims" of the games why they are useful.</p>

                <p>Software developer for about 10 years. I started off at the age of 18 as a developer in the Israeli army (top secret!). A few years later I started working for a start-up company in the field of online fraud detection, which was acquired by PayPal shortly after and so I worked for PayPal for a while. From there I moved from sin-city Tel Aviv to the holy-land of Jerusalem, to study Computer Science and Cognitive Science in the Hebrew University. After graduating I found my way to Klarna, where I’ve been for over 3 years, during which I had the privilege to co-found Rails Girls events in Israel. I’m very passionate about traveling around the world (just recently completed my 30-countries-before-30 challenge!), and also passionate about puzzles in general and puzzle-rooms in particular</p>

                <p>Ruby’s original heresy was to place the happiness of the programmer on a pedestal - above many other competing and valid concerns that had driven programming languages before it. Rails took this one step further with "The Principle of The Bigger Smile”; design with great attention paid to whatever would make developers smile more and broader.</p>

<p>What does that even mean? Lots of examples in this fun lightning talk!</p>

My earlier experience involving working for Skype, Vonage, Telefonica and several startups; touching many different technologies and disciplines. I like solving complex problems, math and physics. Outside of work I am spending most of my time with my family, I have two sons ages 2.5 and one year old so not much time left for anything else.</p>

                <p>While executing performance tests, we want to reuse production data to keep the correct data distribution. For privacy reason, we have implemented a tool which can obfuscate the data while keeping the relations and distribution between the fields as in the original production set. Using the same approach, we also test for future growth by running the same process multiple times.</p>

                <p>Started learning Pascal at school when she was 12 years old. After high school she moved to a University in the desert to study Information Systems Engineer, and after 4 years moved to Tel-Aviv and started working in the Intelligence corps in the Army, first as a product manager and later got back to what she really loved doing - programming. So Klarna is her first after-the-army work place - which she have been with for the last 2 years and had the opportunity to really learn frontend development. Besides work she loves diving, hiking, photographing - and doing all those things while traveling around the world.</p>

                <p>Have you ever refactored your dotfiles instead of preparing for tomorrow's demo? Have you caught your teammate rearranging the SCRUM board for the 3rd time this week? We software people are all too often plagued by procrastination.</p>

<p>In this talk I'll argue that instead of fighting one's weaker self, or more adequately said in German, one's "innerer Schweinehund" one should start embracing the ability to procrastinate as a valuable strength. Let's all put off things together!</p>

                    <p>Ben became passionate about coding at age 8, when it was a welcome distraction from learning the kinds of things 8-year-olds are supposed to learn. Despite his hobby continuing to get in the way he graduated with a degree in Natural Sciences and Middle Eastern Studies from Cambridge University. For reasons best explained over beer, he moved to Israel where his formal education did not help his employment prospects in the slightest. Fortunately it seems that in Tel Aviv people are willing to pay him to do what he loves best, and he ended up writing code for a living. Ben joined Klarna looking to learn from good people. Since then he’s worked with great engineers on Payment Matching, the Settlement App and Personalization. He still can’t tell you what 6*7 is, and his handwriting remains illegible. Passion is a mixed blessing.</p>

  <div class="column small-12 large-4 how__item">
    <h3>We want talks that</h3>
    <p>
    Are innovative. New ideas and creative or surprising solutions.
    Interesting to a wide audience.
    Inspiring. Code that was shared or that helped in unexpected ways. Things that made Klarna a better place to work.
    Based on real experiences. What worked well, and what didn’t.
    Diverse. We want talks on a variety of subjects and speakers from across the organisation.
    Entertaining. Narrative and humor make a big difference.
    </p>

  <div class="column small-12 large-4 how__item">
    <h3>We avoid talks that</h3>
    <p>
    Are better as a brown bag. If your talk is only relevant to part of the organization it might be more suitable as a brown bag.
    Too basic or preaching to the choir. Don’t tell us what we already know or can easily find out by ourselves.
    Design reviews. We’re less interested in what you plan to do, as it’s too soon to say if its good or bad.
    Second hand. We’d rather hear you talk about your hands-on experience than something you heard from someone else.

    <h3>We want lightning talks</h3>

    <p>
    which are fun, inspiring and make the audience laugh and think at the same time.
