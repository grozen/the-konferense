Yet as a society we pressure folks to pigeonhole themselves into silos: pick a major at university, choose an industry to work in, buy a house and settle down. Nowhere is this more true than in the world of tech, where there is often no clear path from engineer or product manager to leader. But what if you want to move around, especially at work? In this talk, Kara shares three key lessons gleaned from over a decade moving seamlessly between the highest levels tech, entertainment, and sports and how you can apply those strategies to your career.",

Luckily chromium just introduced their headless mode and with chrome being one of the most used browsers it supports all web features and also behaves like a real browser. In this session I will introduce you to chromium, the headless mode and how to work with it. Furthermore I will go through changes that we made in our scraping infrastructure to use this technology and features that chromium does not offer so that we had to fork it.",

As a way to achieve this I'll introduce the Business Intelligence team and present the mutual benefits with a partnership. We will also go into some examples on how to use our data, and you might learn a few things about our products that you didn't know before!",

It made me think about user-centered design and its challenges. How can us product developers build products that actually support this approach? How can we design and build products for all user types when they differ so much from one another? This talk is for all you product developers. It is not focused on visual design styles. It is not focused on new technologies either. This talk maps out practices, supported by real-life examples. Following these practices will help you build products that users will love using.",

All you need to know is what the terms mean so you know which functions to call to start getting results! Now that you know the what let's explore the how! You will learn to identify good problems and I will walk you through my own learning experience. Finally, I will give you some tips on how to solve the problems you have today and the ones you will encounter tomorrow (or maybe just let your robot do those too).",

This talk will show you how evolution can be used as an all purpose algorithm to solve some optimisation problems you might run into. It will show you how to model your own evolution by teaching you how to tailor your own, specific crossover and mutation operators and how to choose the fittest individuals to drive forward your search of a solution. To prove that all of this is true and working, we are going to play with some usual and unusual applications of the evolution - from a small world with animals trying to evolve to get more food and mates, to usage of evolution in music composition and medicine.",

Back in 2016, an idea for solving the problems of slow feedback loops and stagnant structures of running Jenkins in KCloud, was born. This was the beginning. In this session I will tell you the story of this Dawn of Joy, full of promises of new, cool features. I will also tell you about the Days of Improvement, during which we were blissfully unaware of the impending D-Day, the KCloud Decommission, the day which put everything to the test. But how did it end? Did it end? Did we solve our initial problem? Did we learn anything by implementing a cool, new, bleeding edge technology? By digging through post mortems and the shared team memory, I'll share the war stories of porting our entire service portfolio to a new platform, and teach you what you need to know if you ever want to go to war.",
