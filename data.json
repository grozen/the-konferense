When we listen to experts and trust in their wisdom, we are fooling ourselves. Meanwhile, software development is one of the more complex tasks that we mere mortals undertake. So what does it really take to overcome the limitations of our biology? How do we overcome our desire to jump to conclusions and guess at solutions? This mildly humorous, entertaining talk explores some of the fallibilities inherent in our biology and addresses what it takes to solve genuinely complex problems in the face of our propensity to make wild guesses? To put it another way, what do you need to understand to completely grasp how agile, lean development, DevOps and Continuous Delivery really work?",

              "description": "Understanding customer payment behaviour is central to the business model of Klarna as part of credit underwriting. Even with great collection it would be very expensive and immoral to grant anyone who asks credit. Therefore, knowing beforehand if a customer is likely to pay their invoice is of great importance to us so that we can choose to reject those that will not be able to, or otherwise lack intent to pay. But how do we do this more specifically? How do we estimate the probability of default and what do we do with it? How can we identify and stop fraudulent purchase attempts automatically?<br/><br />In this talk I will take you through the whole process of decision model development. This includes everything from root cause analysis and data-mining to feature engineering, training and validation of machine learning models and designing decision policies.. I will introduce you to the specific problems we encounter in credit underwriting and how we try to solve these problems in an automated way.",

These scenarios range from semi-targeted phishing campaigns and leakage of wireless-related information to man in the middle attacks and full exploitation of workstations. We will try to make all this relevant to Klarna's environment and attack surface. This is a talk about every day hacking and exploitation techniques that are simple enough to explain to your parents but technical enough to visit stackoverflow after we are done. We will build on last year's lightning talk, but don't worry if you missed it, we will recap quite fast.",

Combined with requirements of horizontal application scalability and statelessness, a traditional data serving solution (e.g. centralised RDBMS) does not cut the cheese. For the past three years Klarna has implemented the Lambda Architecture serving applications with data for real time decisions. Since then, new architectural proposals has emerged in the BigData community. One upriser is the Kappa architecture. In this talk we look at Klarnas current Lambda architecture, then we look at the Kappa proposal including a case study. Finally we discuss how Kappa could replace our current Lambda architecture and what would have to change.",

What should be automated and what shouldn’t? This talk will be an experience-based DevOps journey story of attempting to achieve a stable and organisationally scalable delivery process. It will be an extended version of the lightning talk I did at muCon Stockholm 2015 'Scaling infrastructure work at Klarna'. In the talk I will structure the alternative approaches and principles behind the different deployment tools, what worked and what didn't work for us, where the deployment tools are heading and how can a DevOps person avoid becoming a bottleneck by sharing knowledge within the team.",
